        <h2>About Ada Lovelace</h2>
        <p>
          Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, best known for
          her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose
          computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what
          is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a
          machine, making her the world's first computer programmer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite living in the 1880s, her vision of computing foresaw the
          modern era of technology. She imagined computers doing more than
          calculations - even creating music or art!
